Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

@dev Interface of the ERC-20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in\n https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[ERC-2612].\n Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC-20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by\n presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't\n need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.\n ==== Security Considerations\n There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature\n expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n generally recommended is:\n ```solidity\n function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n     doThing(..., value);\n }\n function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit."},"fullyImplemented":false,"id":1902,"linearizedBaseContracts":[1902],"name":"IERC20Permit","nameLocation":"2126:12:12","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"documentation":{"id":1870,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"2145:850:12","text":" @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n ordering also apply here.\n Emits an {Approval} event.\n Requirements:\n -

@dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712[EIP-712] is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data.\n The encoding scheme specified in the EIP requires a domain separator and a hash

Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to\n produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.\n This contract implements the EIP-712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding\n scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA\n ({_hashTypedDataV4}).\n The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating\n the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.\n NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \"v4\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method\n https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].\n NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain\n separator of the implementation contract.

@dev Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number in Z/nZ.\n If n is a prime, then Z/nZ is a field. In that case all elements are inversible, except 0.\n If n is not a prime, then Z/nZ is not a field, and some elements might not be inversible.\n If the input value is not inversible, 0 is returned.\n NOTE: If you know for sure that n is (big) a prime, it may be cheaper to use Fermat's little theorem and get the\n inverse using `Math.modExp(a, n - 2, n)`.

units to a sort of \\\"representative\\\" that will pool delegated voting units from different accounts and can then use it to vote in decisions. In fact, voting units _must_ be delegated in order to count as actual votes, and an account has to delegate those votes to itself if it wishes to participate in decisions and does not have a trusted representative. This contract is often combined with a token contract such that voting units correspond to token units. For an example, see {ERC721Votes}. The full history of delegate votes is tracked on-chain so that governance protocols can consider votes as distributed at a particular block number to protect against flash loans and double voting. The opt-in delegate system makes the cost of this history tracking optional. When using this module the derived contract must implement {_getVotingUnits} (for example, make it return {ERC721-balanceOf}), and can use {_transferVotingUnits} to track a change in the distribution of those units (in the previous example, it would be included in {ERC721-_update}).\",\"errors\":{\"CheckpointUnorderedInsertion()\":[{\"details\":\"A value was attempted to be inserted on a past checkpoint.\"}],\"ECDSAInvalidSignature()\":[{\"details\":\"The signature derives the `address(0)`.\"}],\"ECDSAInvalidSignatureLength(uint256)\":[{\"details\":\"The signature has an invalid length.\"}],\"ECDSAInvalidSignatureS(bytes32)\":[{\"details\":\"The signature has an S value that is in the upper half order.\"}],\"ERC5805FutureLookup(uint256,uint48)\":[{\"details\":\"Lookup to future votes is not available.\"}],\"ERC6372InconsistentClock()\":[{\"details\":\"The clock was incorrectly modified.\"}],\"InvalidAccountNonce(address,uint256)\":[{\"details\":\"The nonce used for an `account` is not the expected current nonce.\"}],\"SafeCastOverflowedUintDowncast(uint8,uint256)\":[{\"details\":\"Value doesn't fit in an uint of `bits` size.\"}],\"VotesExpiredSignature(uint256)\":[{\"details\":\"The signature used has expired.\"}]},\"events\":{\"DelegateChanged(address,address,address)\":{\"details\":\"Emitted when an account changes their delegate.\"},\"DelegateVotesChanged(address,uint256,uint256)\":{\"details\":\"Emitted when a token transfer or delegate change results in changes to a delegate's number of voting units.\"},\"EIP712DomainChanged()\":{\"details\":\"MAY be emitted to signal that the domain could have changed.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"CLOCK_MODE()\":{\"details\":\"Machine-readable description of the clock as specified in ERC-6372.\"},\"clock()\":{\"details\":\"Clock used for flagging checkpoints.

TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override this function so it returns a different value. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC-20 applications.\",\"errors\":{\"ERC20InsufficientAllowance(address,uint256,uint256)\":[{\"details\":\"Indicates a failure with the `spender`\\u2019s `allowance`.

Voting power can be queried through the public accessors {Votes-getVotes} and {Votes-getPastVotes}. By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper.

The first is that a valid permit signature expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be generally recommended is: ```solidity function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}     doThing(..., value); } function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);     ... } ``` Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}). Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()\":{\"details\":\"Returns the domain separator used in the encoding of the signature for {permit}, as defined by {EIP712}.\"},\"nonces(address)\":{\"details\":\"Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`. This contract implements the EIP-712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA ({_hashTypedDataV4}). The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain. NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \\\"v4\\\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask]. NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain separator of the implementation contract.

To create a history of checkpoints define a variable type `Checkpoints.Trace*` in your contract, and store a new checkpoint for the current transaction block using the {push} function.\",\"errors\":{\"CheckpointUnorderedInsertion()\":[{\"details\":\"A value was attempted to be inserted on a past checkpoint.\"}]},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/structs/Checkpoints.sol\":\"Checkpoints\"},\"evmVersion\":\"cancun\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Panic.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf7fe324703a64fc51702311dc51562d5cb1497734f074e4f483bfb6717572d7a\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://c6a5ff4f9fd8649b7ee20800b7fa387d3465bd77cf20c2d1068cd5c98e1ed57a\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmVSaVJf9FXFhdYEYeCEfjMVHrxDh5qL4CGkxdMWpQCrqG\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x1225214420c83ebcca88f2ae2b50f053aaa7df7bd684c3e878d334627f2edfc6\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6c5fab4970634f9ab9a620983dc1c8a30153981a0b1a521666e269d0a11399d3\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmVRnBC575MESGkEHndjujtR7qub2FzU9RWy9eKLp4hPZB\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x195533c86d0ef72bcc06456a4f66a9b941f38eb403739b00f21fd7c1abd1ae54\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b1d578337048cad08c1c03041cca5978eff5428aa130c781b271ad9e5566e1f8\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPFKL2r9CBsMwmUqqdcFPfHZB2qcs9g1HDrPxzWSxomvy\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/structs/Checkpoints.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe32a5a466492f6a3b871d705d045fc2f8d6e6c8bf69288011531ff875003993f\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://61c69a907ca80a9cff4bdf30f64d5ee458a6c54f0a87ed7e4c2a1b9275256851\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmVmhbvE7w5Hs9tj9NBPLk6yAirrEhaRYgTRT9USat4H9a\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/types/Time.sol":{"Time":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"60556032600b8282823980515f1a607314602657634e487b7160e01b5f525f60045260245ffd5b305f52607381538281f3fe730000000000000000000000000000000000000000301460806040525f80fdfea264697066735822122058fc0ec918a8e898c8028b2898b0811f32902b6d863df67c762f0a7a8e6486f764736f6c63430008180033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x55 PUSH1 0x32 PUSH1 0xB DUP3 DUP3 DUP3 CODECOPY DUP1 MLOAD PUSH0 BYTE PUSH1 0x73 EQ PUSH1 0x26 JUMPI PUSH4 0x4E487B71 PUSH1 0xE0 SHL PUSH0 MSTORE PUSH0 PUSH1 0x4 MSTORE PUSH1 0x24 PUSH0 REVERT JUMPDEST ADDRESS PUSH0 MSTORE PUSH1 0x73 DUP2 MSTORE8 DUP3 DUP2 RETURN INVALID PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 PC 0xFC 0xE 0xC9 XOR 0xA8 0xE8 SWAP9 0xC8 MUL DUP12 0x28 SWAP9 0xB0 DUP2 0x1F ORIGIN SWAP1 0x2B PUSH14 0x863DF67C762F0A7A8E6486F76473 PUSH16 0x6C634300081800330000000000000000 ","sourceMap":"640:4515:26:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;-1:-1:-1;;;640:4515:26;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"730000000000000000000000000000000000000000301460806040525f80fdfea264697066735822122058fc0ec918a8e898c8028b2898b0811f32902b6d863df67c762f0a7a8e6486f764736f6c63430008180033","opcodes":"PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 PC 0xFC 0xE 0xC9 XOR 0xA8 0xE8 SWAP9 0xC8 MUL DUP12 0x28 SWAP9 0xB0 DUP2 0x1F ORIGIN SWAP1 0x2B PUSH14 0x863DF67C762F0A7A8E6486F76473 PUSH16 0x6C634300081800330000000000000000 ","sourceMap":"640:4515:26:-:0;;;;;;;;"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.24+commit.e11b9ed9\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"This library provides helpers for manipulating time-related objects.
